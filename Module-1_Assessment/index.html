            <p>Hello, my name is Ashley Edmunds. This is my first time making a webpage using back-end technology and I'm having a blast! This career field and the work that comes along with it is very appealing to me as it requires a meticulous mind yet allows the developer to utilize their creativity . </p>

            <p>When I'm not learning how to properly use Bootstrap, I enjoy spending time outdoors and participating in activities such as hiking, biking, and swimming, to name a few. I enjoy learning new skills so I've recently started learning how to play the piano. I haven't quite mastered it yet, but it's only been one week.</p>

            <p>Although it may seem that I have no time to rest, I do have a tendency to binge watch tv shows when I have enough free time. I'm currently watching the Netflix tv show "Money Heist" and enjoy watching "Grey's Anatomy" as background noise when doing chores at times. </p>
