HTML and Basic CSS Assessment

In the unsolved folder, I have index.html and style.css which is one way I discovered to achieve the finished product in a more advanced way through google while index2.html and style2.css is another way I achieved the finished product sticking to what was learned and provided in the modules. 

The reason I did not use git push for index2.html and style2.css into github is because I did not change the file name for index.html and style.css before making changes to them using methods described in the modules.
